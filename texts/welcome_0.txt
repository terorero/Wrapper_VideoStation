==================== Wrapper for VideoStation and DLNA MediaServer for DTS, EAC3 and TrueHD with transcoding to AAC 5.1: ====================
Synology VideoStation and MediaServer ffmpeg wrapper with DTS, EAC3 and TrueHD support. 
It enables hardware transcoding from Synology's ffmpeg for video and transcoding DTS, HEVC, EAC3, AAC, True HD from the ffmpeg of the SynoCommunity. 

When the Wrapper FFmpeg needs to transcoding you will have 2 audio's streams from the SAME track:
- In DLNA MediaServer = [1) AAC 5.1 512kbps AND 2) MP3 2.0 256kbps.] (by default)
- In  VIDEO-STATION   = [1) MP3 2.0 256kbp  AND 2) AAC 5.1 512kbps.] (by default)*
*(For Chromecast or Google TV or other clients that don´t accept 5.1 AAC neither multi audio's stream support).

Now, You can change the 5.1 audio´s codec from AAC 512kbps to AC3 640kbps independently of its audio´s streams order in VIDEO-STATION and DLNA MediaServer 
using the Configurator TOOL embedded into the Installer. 
(AC3 is more compatible with legacy 5.1 devices).

Works fine the OffLine transcoding and the streaming of tipical extensions like: MKV, MP4, AVI... Works fine the thumbnails in VideoStation.
You will have full control of each Audio's codecs parameter using the Configuration TOOL for the Advanced Wrapper Mode. 
The only Wrapper of Internet with 5.1 AAC support and with a Configurator TOOL.
