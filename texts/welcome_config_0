 
\u001b[33mREMEMBER: If you change the order in VIDEO-STATION you will have ALWAYS AAC 5.1 512kbps (or AC3 5.1 640kbps) in first audio stream and some devices not compatibles with 5.1 neigther multi audio streams like Chromecast will not work.
\u001b[32mNow you can change the audio's codec from from AAC 512kbps to AC3 640kbps independently of its audio's streams order.
AC3 640kbps has a little bit less quality and worse performance than AAC but is more compatible with LEGACY devices.
Changing the audio stream's order automatically will put again 2 audio Streams.
